Overall, my impression of Go is that it's C but without a lot of the annoying stuff. It's nice that there's a lot of built in stuff so you can get away without needing a framework like Flash or Express to start servers easily

To start a go program, write `go run .\FileName.go

`FirstTime.go` has an example of starting a server that returns JSON
